<h2>
    REMARKS.
</h2>
<p>
In this drama are comprised tragedy, comedy, opera, and some degree
of farce&mdash;yet so happily is the variety blended, that one scene never
diminishes the interest of another, but they all combine to produce a
most valuable composition.
</p>
<p>
In the rank of excellence, the tragic parts are to be accounted
foremost; and, among these, the original and admirable character of
Eustache de St. Pierre stands first.
</p>
<p>
Other characters, of the author's invention, are likewise so prominent,
that Edward, our renowned conqueror of Calais, is made, perhaps, the
least interesting, as well as the least amiable, warrior in this whole
dramatic field of glory: and yet, such is the equitable, the unbiassed
judgment of the vanquished, they profess a just, a noble, an heroic
reverence, for the bravery, and other qualities, of their triumphant
enemies.
</p>
<p>
The exception to this general rule of patriotic courage in the French,
is most skilfully displayed in one short speech, by a feeble and
fearful citizen of the besieged town; in whom extreme terror of the
besiegers is so naturally converted into malignant abhorrence,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[4]</span>

  that the
man who, in all Calais, is most ready to die for his king and country,
is, by the aid of certain political logic from this alarmist, openly
accused of disloyalty, because he will not slander, as well as fight,
his foe. This speech, with some others, no less founded on the true
disposition of lordly man, subdued by the humiliation of fear, would
falsely imply&mdash;that the play of "The Surrender of Calais" was of a
later date than fifteen or sixteen years past, before which period the
author must have had much less knowledge of the influence of apprehension
in the time of war, than experience, or rather observation, has since
had the means to bestow upon him.
</p>
<p>
It may be said, that Mr. Colman gave the virtues of justice and
benignity to the valiant part of the French, merely as instruments to
resound the praise of the English.&mdash;Whatever were the author's views,
the virtues remain the same, and honour the possessors of them, even
more than their eulogiums can do honour to the British.
</p>
<p>
In the first act, the weak, mournful huzza, wrung from the throats of
the half-famished soldiers, and that military subordination exhibited
between Ribaumont and La Gloire, upon the pronunciation of the word
<i>march</i>, are happy stage occurrences, in which the reader's fancy will
not perhaps delight, for want of the performer's tones and action.&mdash;But
there are other scenes so independent of the mimic art, that acting can
rarely improve them&mdash;Such is the scene in the Hall, the delivery of the
keys, the farewell between the father and the son, with others equally
impressive.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>[5]</span>

            But the highest panegyric that can be pronounced on this
play is&mdash;that "The Surrender of Calais" is considered, by every critic,
as the very best of all the author's numerous and successful productions.

<h3>
SCENE I.
</h3>
<p class="scene">
    <i>A View of Calais, the Sea, and the English Camp.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Ribaumont</span> and <span class="sc">La Gloire</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> Thus far in safety. All is hush. Our subtle air of France
quickens not the temperament of the enemy. These phlegmatic English
snore out the night, in as gross heaviness as when their senses
stagnate in their own native fogs, where stupor lies like lead upon
them,&mdash;which the muddy rogues call sleep. We have nearly passed the
entrenchments;&mdash;the day breaks.&mdash;La Gloire!
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> My commander!
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> Where did you direct our mariners to meet us, with the boat?
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Marry, I told them to meet us with the boat at the sea
shore.
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> Vague booby! at what point?
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> That's the point I was coming to, my lord! and, if a
certain jutting out of land, in the shape of a white cliff, with brown
furze on its top, like a bushy head of hair over a pale face, stand
where it did&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> East of the town:&mdash;I have mark'd it.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Look you there, now! what I have hunted after, a whole
day, to fix upon, hath he noted without labour. Oh, the capacious heads
of your great officers!&mdash;No wonder they are so careful of them in
battle; and thrust forward the pitiful pates of the privates, to be
mowed off like a parcel of daisies.&mdash;But there lies the spot&mdash;and there
will the mariners come. We are now within ear-shot; and, when they are
there, they will whistle.
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> And, till they give the signal, here, if there be aught of
safety to be picked from danger, is the least dangerous spot to tarry
for them. We are here full early.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> I would we were not here at all. This same scheme of
victualling a town, blockaded by the enemy, is a service for which I
have little appetite.
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> Think, La Gloire, on the distress of our countrymen&mdash;the
inhabitants perishing with hunger.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Truly, my lord, it doth move the bowels of my compassion.
Yet, consider your risk&mdash;consider your rank! The gallant Count
Ribaumont, flower of chivalry, cream of the French army, and commander
of his regiment, turned cook to the corporation of Calais!&mdash;carving his
way to glory, through stubble-rumped capons, unskinned mutton, raw
veal, and vegetables!&mdash;and, perhaps, my lord, just before we are able
to serve up the meat to the town, in comes a raw-boned Englishman, and
runs his spit through your body!
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> Pr'ythee, no more objections.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Nay, I object not,&mdash;I;&mdash;but I have served your honour, in
and out of the army, babe

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span>

                           boy, and man, these five and twenty years,
come the next feast of the Virgin; and Heaven forfend I should be out
of service, by being out of my master!
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> Well, well, I know thy zeal.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> And yet your English rapier is a marvellous sudden
dissolver of attachments. 'Twill sever the closest connexions. 'Twill
even whip you, for ever, friend head from his intimate acquaintance,
neck and shoulders, before they have time to take leave:&mdash;Not that I
object;&mdash;yet men do not always sleep. The fat centinel, as we passed
the outpost, might have waked with his own snoring; and&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   <i>Ribau.</i> Peace! Remember your duty to me; to your country.</p>
<p class="i2">   Yet, out, alas! I mock myself to name it.</p>
<p class="i2">   Did not these rugged battlements of Calais;</p>
<p class="i2">   This tomb, yet safeguard of its citizens,</p>
<p class="i2">   Which shuts the sword out, and locks hunger in;</p>
<p class="i2">   (Where many a wretch, pale, gaunt, and famine-shrunk,</p>
<p class="i2">   Smiles, ghastly, at the slaughter's threat, and dies:)</p>
<p class="i2">   Did not these walls&mdash;like Vulcan's swarthy arms,</p>
<p class="i2">   Clasping sweet beauty's queen&mdash;encircle now,</p>
<p class="i2">   Within their cold and ponderous embrace,</p>
<p class="i2">   The fair, yet, ah! I fear, the fickle Julia,</p>
<p class="i2">   My sluggish zeal would lack the spur to rouse it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> And, of all the spurs in the race of mortality, love is
the only true tickler to quicken a man's motions. But to reconcile a
mistress by victualling a town!&mdash;Well; dark and puzzling is the road to
woman's affection; but this is the first time I ever heard of sliding
into her heart through her palate; or choking her anger, by stopping
her mouth with a meal. An' this pantry fashion of wooing should last,
woe to the ill-favoured! Beauty will raise the price of provisions, and
poor ugliness soon be starved out of the country.

reputation&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> No more! mark me, La Gloire! As your officer, I may command
you onward: but, in respect to your early attachment, your faithful
service, ere you followed me to the army, if your mind misgive you in
this undertaking, you have my leave to retreat.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> I say, you are free to return.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Look ye, my lord! I am son to brave old Eustache de St.
Pierre; as tough a citizen as any in all Calais: I was carried into
your lordship's father's family (your lordship being then but just
born) at six days old; a mere whelp, as a body may say. According to
puppy reckoning, my lord, I was with you three days before I could
see. I have followed you through life, frisking and trotting after your
lordship ever since: and, if you think me, now, mongrel enough to turn
tail, and leave my master in a scrape, why, 'twere kinder e'en to hang
me up at the next tree, than cut me through the heart with your
suspicions.
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> No, La Gloire,&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> No, my lord! 'tis fear for you makes me bold to speak. To
see you running your head through stone walls for a woman&mdash;and a woman
who, though she be an angel, has (saving your presence) played you but
a scurvy sort of a jade's trick; and&mdash;&mdash;

honour to carry arms under his christian majesty, Philip the Sixth,
King of France, called coward! <i>Sacre bleu!</i> Have I already served in
three campaigns, and been thumped, and bobbed about, by the English, to
be called coward at last! Oh, that any but my commander had said it!
</p>
<p>
<i>Ribau.</i> Well, well, La Gloire, I may have been hasty: I&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Oh, my lord!&mdash;it&mdash;'tis no matter. But, haply, you'd like
to be convinced of the courage of your company; and if such a thing as
raising the enemy's camp can clear a man's character, I can do it as
soon as&mdash;&mdash;

<p>

<p>
<i>Serg.</i> I know not, sir, for their hearts; but I'll warrant them stout
stomachs. Hunger is so powerful in them, that I fear me they'll munch
their way through the stone walls of the city.

<p>
<i>Officer.</i> This famine pinches. Poor rogues! Cheer them with hopes,
good Sergeant.
</p>
<p>
<i>Serg.</i> Hope, your honour, is but a meagre mess for a regiment. Hope
has almost shrunk them out of their doublets. Hope has made their legs
so weary of the lease they had taken of their hose, that all their
calves have slunk away from the premises. There isn't a stocking in the
whole company that can boast of a tolerable tenant. The privates join
in the public complaining; the drummers grow noisy; our

</p>
<p>
<i>Serg.</i> Troth, sir, I do my best:&mdash;when they grumble for meat, I make
them eat their own words; and give them some solid counsel, well
seasoned with the pepper of correction.

guards to their several posts.

<p>
<i>Serg.</i> Now must I administer consolation, and give the rogues their
daily meal of encouragement.&mdash;Hem! Countrymen, fellow soldiers, and
Frenchmen!&mdash;be of good cheer, for famine is come upon you, and you are
all in danger of starving. Is there any thing dearer to a Frenchman
than his honour? Isn't honour the greater, the greater the danger?
and has any body ever had the honour of being in greater danger than
you?&mdash;Rejoice, then, for your peril is extreme! Be merry, for you have
a glorious dismal prospect before you; and as pleasing a state of
desperation as the noble heart of a soldier could wish! Come! one cheer
for the glory of France.&mdash;St. Dennis, and our Grand Monarque, King
Philip the Sixth!

Oons! it sounds as hollow as a churchyard. The voice comes through
their wizen mouths like wind from the crack of an old wainscot. Away,
rogues, to your posts! Bristle up your courage, and wait the event of
time! Remember ye are Frenchmen, and bid defiance to famine! Our
mistresses are locked up with us in the town; we have frogs in the
wells, and snuff at the merchants'. An Englishman, now, would hang
himself upon this, which is enough to make a gay Frenchman happy.

neighbours! Thus does many a fool-hardy booby, like me, run his head
into danger; and

                  a few empty huzzas, which leave him at the next turning
of a corner, are all he gets for his pains. Now, while all the town
is gone to dinner, will I go to woo. My poor Madelon must be woefully
fallen away, since I quitted Calais, Heigho! I've lost, I warrant me,
a good half of my mistress since we parted. I have secured for her the
daintiest bits of our whole cargo, as marks of my affection. A butcher
couldn't show her more tenderness than I shall. If love were now
weighed out by the pound, bating my master, the Count Ribaumont, who is
in love with Lady Julia, not all the men in the city could balance the
scales with me.

SCENE III.
</h3>
<p class="scene">
    <i>A Hall, in the House of <span class="sc">John de Vienne</span>.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Julia</span> and <span class="sc">O'Carrol</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Now, O'Carrol; what is the time of day?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Fait, Lady Julia, we might have called it a little past
breakfast time, formerly; but since the fashion of eating has been worn
out in Calais, a man may be content to say it bears hard upon ten. Och!
if clocks were jacks now, time would stand still; and the year would go
down, for the want of winding up every now and then.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Saw you my father this morning?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> You may say that.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> How looked he, O'Carrol?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> By my soul! Lady Julia, that old father of yours, and
master of mine, is a gallant gentleman. And gallantly he bears himself.
For certain, and so he ought; being a Knight of Burgundy, and Governor

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>[22]</span>

 of Calais; but if I was Governor just now, to be sure I should not
like to take a small trip from Calais, one morning, just to see what
sort of a knight I was in Burgundy.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Who has he in his company?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Why, madam, why&mdash;now dare not I tell who, for fear of
offending her.&mdash;Company? Why, to be sure I have been in his company:&mdash;for
want of finer acquaintance, madam, he was e'en forced to put up, half an
hour, with an humble friend.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   <i>Julia.</i> Poor fool! thy words are shrewder than thy meaning.</p>
<p class="i2">   How many crowd the narrow space of life</p>
<p class="i2">   With those gay, gaudy flowers of society,</p>
<p class="i2">   Those annuals, call'd acquaintance; which do fade</p>
<p class="i2">   And die away, ere we can say they blosom;</p>
<p class="i2">   Mocking the idle cultivator's care,</p>
<p class="i2">   From year to year; while one poor slip of friendship,</p>
<p class="i2">   Hardy, tho' modest, stands the winter's frost,</p>
<p class="i2">   And cheers its owner's eye with evergreen!</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Troth, lady, one honest potatoe in a garden is worth an
hundred beds of your good-for-nothing tulips. Oh! 'tis meat and drink
to me to see a friend! and, truly 'tis lucky, in this time of famine,
to have one in the house to look at, to keep me from starving. Little
did I think, eight years ago, when I came over among fifty thousand
brave boys&mdash;English, Irish, and else,&mdash;to fight under King Edward,
who now lies before Calais here, that I should find such a warm soul
towards me in a Frenchman's body;&mdash;especially when the business, that
brought me, was to help to give his countrymen a beating.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Thy gratitude, O'Carrol, has well repaid the pains my father
took in preserving thee.
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Gratitude! fait, madam, begging your pardon, 'tis no such
thing; 'tis nothing but showing the sense I have of my obligation.
There was I, in the year 1339, in the English camp&mdash;on the fields of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>[23]</span>

 Vianfosse, near Capelle&mdash;which never came to an action; excepting a
trifling bit of skirmish, in which my good cruel friends left me for
dead out of our lines; when a kind enemy&mdash;your father&mdash;(a blessing on
his friendly heart for it!) picked me up, and set the breath agoing
again, that was almost thumped out of my body. He saved my life; it is
but a poor commodity;&mdash;but, as long as it lasts, by my soul! he and his
family shall have the wear and tear of it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Thou hast been a trusty follower, O'Carrol; nay, more a friend
than follower; thou art entwined in all the interests of our house, and
art as attached to me as to my father.
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Ay, troth, Lady Julia, and a good deal more; more shame to
me for it; because I am indebted for all to the Governor. I don't know
how it may be with wiser nations, but if regard is to go to a whole
family, there's a something about the female part of it that an
Irishman can't help giving the preference to, for the soul of him.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> But, tell me, who is with my father?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Indeed that I will not&mdash;for a reason.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> And what may the reason be?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Because, long before he arrived, you bid me never mention
his name. It may be, perhaps, the noble gentleman who has just succoured
the town.&mdash;Well, if I must not say who is with my master, I may say who
my master is with.&mdash;It is the Count Ribaumont.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Why should I tremble at that name? Why should my tongue be now
constrained to speak the language of my heart? O father! father!
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Och&mdash;ho!
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Why dost thou sigh, O'Carrol?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Truly, madam, I was thinking of a piece of a rich old uncle
I had in Ireland; who sent me to the French wars, to tear me away from
a dear little creature I loved better than my eyes.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Julia.</i> And wast thou ever in love, O'Carrol?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> That I was, faith, up to my chin. I never think upon it but
it remembers me of the song that was wont to be played by honest Clamoran,
poor fellow, our minstrel, in the north.

<div class="poem">

<p class="i2">   <i>Julia.</i> I pr'ythee sing it to me, good O'Carrol;</p>

                                   all! I cannot but own a full meal
makes an improvement in the warmth of my feelings. I can eat and drink
myself into a glow of tenderness, that fasting can never come up to.
And what hast thou done in my absence, Madelon?
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Little, La Gloire, but grieve with the rest. I have thought
on you; gone to confession in the morning; seemed happy, in the day, to
cheer my poor old father:&mdash;but my heart was bursting, La Gloire:&mdash;and,
at night, by myself, I looked at this little cross you gave me, and
cried.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Smothering his Tears.</i>]</span> Madelon, I,&mdash;I&mdash;I want another
draught of burgundy.

<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Drinks.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Once, indeed,&mdash;I thought it was hard,&mdash;Father Antony
enjoined me penance, for thinking so much about you.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> An old&mdash;&mdash;What, by putting peas in your shoes, as usual?
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Yes; but, as it happened, I escaped.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Ay, marry! how?
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Why, as the famine pressed, the holy fathers had boiled all
our punishments, in puddings for the convent; and there was not a
penitential pea left in the town.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> O, gluttony! to deprive the innocent of their hard, dry
penances, and apply them, soft, to their own offending stomachs! I
never could abide these pampered friars. They are the pot-bellied
children of the Pope, nursed at the bosom of old mother church; and
plaguy chubby boys they are. One convent of them, in a town, breeds
a famine sooner than an English blockade. But, what says thy father
within, here, Madelon, to our marriage?
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Truly, he has no objection, but in respect to your being a
soldier.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Sacre bleu! object to my carrying arms! my glory! my pride!
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Pr'ythee, now, 'tis not for that.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Degrade my profession!&mdash;my&mdash;look ye, Madelon; I love thee
with all my heart&mdash;with an honest soldier's heart&mdash;else I could tell
your father, that a citizen could never get on in the world, without a
soldier to do his journey-work:&mdash;and your soldier, look ye&mdash;'sblood! it
makes me fret like a hot day's march!&mdash;your soldier, in all nations,
when he is rusted down to your quiet citizen, and so sets up at home
for himself, is in double respect, for having served such an honourable
apprenticeship.
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Nay, now, La Gloire, my father meant not&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Marry, I would tell your father this to his teeth; which,
were it not for my captain and me&mdash;two soldiers, mark you me&mdash;might
not, haply, have been so soon set a going.
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Ungenerous! I could not have spoken such cutting words
to you, La Gloire.&mdash;My poor father only meant, that the wars might
separate us. But I had a remedy for that, too, for all your unkindness.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Pish!&mdash;remedy?&mdash;well&mdash;psha!&mdash;what was the remedy, Madelon?
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Why, I could have followed you to the camp.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> And wouldst thou follow me then?
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Ay, surely, La Gloire: I could follow him I love all over
the world.
</p>
<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> And bear the fatigue of a campaign, Madelon?
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Any thing with you, La Gloire. I warrant us, we should
be happy enough. Ay, and I could be useful too. I could pack your
knapsack; sing canzonets with you, to make us merry on a day's march;
mix in the soldier's dance upon occasion; and, at sun-set, I would
dress up our little tent, as neat as any captain's in the field: then,
at supper, La Gloire, we should be as cheerful!&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>
<i>La Gloire.</i> Now could I cut my tongue out for what I have said!&mdash;Cuff
me; slap my face, Madelon; then kiss me, and forgive me: and, if ever
I bestride my great war-horse again, and let him run away with me, and
trample over the heart of my best friends, I wish he may kick me off,
and break my neck in a ditch for my pains.&mdash;But&mdash;what&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;what
should we do with our children, Madelon?
</p>
<p>
<i>Madelon.</i> Ah! mon Dieu! I had forgot that:&mdash;but if your endeavours be
honest, La Gloire, Providence will take care of them, I warrant you.

    <i>An Apartment in the House of <span class="sc">John de Vienne</span>.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Julia</span>, in Man's Apparel, and <span class="sc">O'Carrol</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Come on; bestir thee, good fellow! Thou must be my guide, and
conduct me.
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> 'Faith, and I'll conduct you, with all my heart and soul;
and some good creature, I warrant, will be kind enough to show me the
way.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> But art thou well assured, O'Carrol, of what thou hast
informed me?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> To be sure I am well assured; for I informed myself, and
I never yet catched myself out in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>[52]</span>

                                  telling a lie. There was six of
them, as tall fellows as any in France, with ugly ropes about their
good-looking necks, going to the town-gates; and Count Ribaumont
marched second in the handsome half dozen. The whole town followed them
with their eyes, till they were as full of water as if they had been
peeping into so many mustard pots. And so, madam, knowing he loves you
better than dear life,(which, to be sure, he seems to hold cheap enough
at present), and thinking you would be glad to hear the terrible news,
why, I made all the haste I could to come and tell it to you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> And thus, in haste, have I equipped myself. Come, good
O'Carrol;&mdash;dost think I shall 'scape discovery in these accoutrements?
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Escape!&mdash;By my soul, lady, one would think you had been a
young man, from the very first day you were born. Och! what a piece of
work a little trimming and drapery makes in a good fellow's fancy! A
foot is a foot, all the world over;&mdash;but take the foot of the sweetest
little creature that ever tripped over green sward, and if it doesn't
play at bo-peep under a petticoat&mdash;'faith, I don't know the reason of
it; but it gives a clean contrary turn to a man's imagination. But what
is it you would be after now, Lady Julia?
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Something I will do; and it must be speedy: at all hazards, we
will to the English camp, O'Carrol:&mdash;opportunity must shape the rest.
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> The camp?&mdash;O, 'faith, that's my element; and Heaven send us
success in it! If an Irishman's prayers, lady, could make you happy,
your little heart should soon be as light as a feather-bed.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> I thank thee, my honest fellow: thy care for me shall not long
go unrewarded.
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Now the devil fetch rewarding, say I! If a man does his
best friends a piece of service, he must be an unconscionable sort of
an honest fellow, to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>[53]</span>

                      look for more reward than the pleasure he gets in
assisting them.
</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Well, well! each moment now is precious! Haste thee, O'Carrol;
Time has wings.
</p>
<p>
<i>O'Carrol.</i> Och! be asey, madam; we'll take the ould fellow by the
forelock, I warrant him. When honest gentlemen's business calls them on
a small walk to the gallows, a man may set out a quarter of an hour
behind them, and be certain of meeting them upon the road:&mdash;and, now I
bethink me, madam, if we go out at the draw-bridge, from the citadel,
hard by the house here, we may be at the camp, ere the poor souls have
marched their body round the battlements.

thousand miles beyond it.

forth. Join me a few minutes hence in the hall, O'Carrol.

Faith, now, I can't make out that same crying, for the life of me. My
sorrow is always of a dry sort; that gives me a sore throat, without
ever-troubling my eyes about the business. The camp! Well, with all my
heart: it won't be the first time I have been present at a bit of a
bustle.

SCENE II.

<p class="scene">
    <i>The English Camp.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>A Scaffold in the Back of the Scene: <span class="sc">Two Workmen</span> descend from it.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>1 Work.</i> There 'tis;&mdash;and finished: as pleasing a piece of work, as
man could wish to turn out of hand. If King Edward, (Heaven bless him!)
give me not a pension for this, let'n make the next scaffold himself.
Mass! I would (with reverence be it spoken), build a scaffold, and fix
a gallows, with any king in Christendom.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Work.</i> Yea, marry, if he had not served his time to the trade.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Work.</i> Yea, or if he had. I have been prime gallows maker, and
principal hangman, now, nine-and-twenty years.&mdash;Thank Heaven!
neighbour, I have long been notorious.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Work.</i> Thou say'st true, indeed. Thy enemies cannot deny thee that.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Work.</i> And why, I pray you? why have I been so?
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Work.</i> Mass, I know not! I think 'tis thy good luck.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Work.</i> Tut, I will tell thee. My parents, I thank them, bred me to
the gallows: marry, then, how was it?&mdash;why, look you, I took delight
in my business.&mdash;An you would be a good workman, ever, while you live,
take a delight in your business. I have been an honest, pains-taking
man, neighbour. No one is notorious, without taking pains for it.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Work.</i> Truly, then, I fear my character is naught. I never can bring
myself to take pains for it.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Work.</i> Thou art the more to be pitied. I never

                                                  made but one small
mistake, since I entered on business.
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Work.</i> I pr'ythee, now, tell me that.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Work.</i> 'Twas on execution day; we were much thronged, and the signal
was given full soon; when, a pize on it! I whips me, in haste, the
halter over the neck of an honest stander-by:&mdash;and I jerks me him up to
the top of a twenty foot gibbet. Marry, the true rogue escaped by't;
for 'twas a full hour ere the error was noted. But, hast heard who the
six be, that will be here anon?
</p>
<p>
<i>2 Work.</i> Only that they be citizens. They are e'en now coming hitherward.
Some of our men have seen them: they march, as 'tis reported, wondrous
doleful.
</p>
<p>
<i>1 Work.</i> No matter; tarry till they see my work;&mdash;that's all. An that
do not content them, mark them for sour knaves. An a man be not
satisfied when a sets foot on my scaffold, say he is hard to please.
Rot them, your condemned men, now-a-days, have no discernment. I would
I had the hanging of all my fellow craft! I should then have some
judges of my skill; and merit would not go praiseless.&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>A

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
